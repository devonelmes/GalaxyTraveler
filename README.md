This is our final project for COP3530 - Data Structures and Algorithms, Fall 2025.

Our program will parse the data and store it in an unsorted container.
It will prompt the user for actions, to find the k (specified by user) closest galaxies.
It will then use two different search algorithms to find them and display it to the user.

Installing dependencies:
> pip install customtkinter
> pip install pillow
Our dataset can be found here: https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/Library/Distances/
