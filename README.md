Team: Devon Elmes, Lang Cao, Melissa Cote
This is our final project for COP3530 - Data Structures and Algorithms, Fall 2025.

Our dataset ca be found here: https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/Library/Distances/

Our program will parce the data and store it in an unsorted container.
It will prompt the user for actions, to find the k (specified by user) closest galaxies.
It will then use two different search algorithms to find them to display to the user.
